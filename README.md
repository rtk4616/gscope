# gscope
An interactive source code browsing tool for C.

It can also provide limited support for other languages as well.

C++ is supported but the scanner can be confused by the use of many templates.

Acknowledgements
================

Gscope origin code was based on cscope (open) sources originating in the mid
1990s.  Subsequent refactoring and merging of cscope updates have led to the
source code provided here today.  Much of the code would not be recognizable
to the original authors, but a few portions (like the scanner) are remarkably
unchanged.

Recommended Stable Versions
===========================

Gscope  Version 2.18

Gscope3 Version 3.16 (3.18 has a critical configuration error do not use.  For now, use 3.16 or build from the tip of Master)
